## `spatial` - spatial distribution of mutations

These notebooks use mutation tables generated in `filtering`.

- Annotation analysis - `analysis.Rmd`

This notebook compares the proportion of new mutations across genomic
annotations in the three datasets. The analysis is then also repeated
for candidate salt genes from Perrineau 2014 more specifically.

- Compare intermutation distances - `intermutation_distances.Rmd`

This notebook calculates mutation distances using positions and compares
them across the three datasets.
