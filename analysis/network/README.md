## `network` - scripts for network analyses

See [here](https://github.com/saraelshawa/Network-Mutations) for other scripts.

Scripts in this repo require the `networkx` Python package. This repo
also contains scripts for a flux balance analysis using the _C. reinhardtii_
metabolic network, but due to the extremely limited overlap between nodes in this
network and genes mutated in our study it was ultimately omitted. 

- Resample nodes and compute shortest paths - `shortest_path_resamples.py`

Given a network in GML format, resamples nodes with replacement for a given
number of times and returns all x all shortest paths between resampled nodes. 
Can optionally take in a list of genes to sample from (default behaviour is to
sample from full GML network). 

- `shortest_path.Rmd`

Notebook containing analyses on resamples generated by `shortest_path_resamples.py`.
