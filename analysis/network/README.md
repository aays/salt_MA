## `network` - scripts for network analyses

See [here](https://github.com/saraelshawa/Network-Mutations) for other scripts.

Scripts in this directory require the `networkx` Python package. This directory
also contains scripts for a flux balance analysis using the _C. reinhardtii_
metabolic network, but due to the extremely limited overlap between nodes in this
network and genes mutated in our study it was ultimately omitted. 

- Resample nodes and compute shortest paths - `shortest_path_resamples.py`

Given a network in GML format, resamples nodes with replacement for a given
number of times and returns all x all shortest paths between resampled nodes. 
Can optionally take in a list of genes to sample from (default behaviour is to
sample from full GML network). 

Usage:

```bash
python shortest_path_resamples.py \
--fname nodes.txt \ # optional - nodes to resample from - default is full network
--treatment treatment_nodes.txt \ # list of treatment (HS) nodes, for resample size
--gml ChlamyNET.gml \
--replicates 100 \
--out path/to/outfile
```

- `shortest_path.Rmd`

Notebook containing analyses on resamples generated by `shortest_path_resamples.py`.
